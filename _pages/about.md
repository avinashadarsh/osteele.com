Hi, I’m Oliver — programmer; serial founder; amateur juggler; husband; father of two.

I've worked at [Apple](http://apple.com/) (consumer electronics and computers),
[Nest](https://nest.com/) (Wi-Fi-connected learning thermostats),
AOL Palo Alto (during the reboot — not as stodgy as it sounds), and a bunch of start-ups.

Based in Greenfield, Massachusetts — I’ve spent most of my life commuting to Boston and/or telecommuting to California.
