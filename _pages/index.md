# Current Projects

I'm finishing up a two-year visiting position at  the [Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering](http://www.olin.edu) in Needham, MA.
My most recent course offering was [Hacking the Library](https://hackingthelibrary.org/), where we launched the [Olin Community Calendar](https://github.com/olin-build/abe-web).
I'm currently working on [olin.build](https://olin.build).

I'll be attending [Dinacon](https://www.dinacon.org/) June 27â€“July 7.

Active coding projects are listed [here](https://code.osteele.com).
