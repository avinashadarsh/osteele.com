I believe in working for, and in hiring, people that I can learn from.

I believe that the jobs of management include making the organization comprehensible to individuals (by making it simpler where possible, and by simplifying its presentation where not); and making individuals comprehensible to the organization (by promoting their efforts and insuring that they stay connected and strategic).

I believe in creating and maintaining alignment, where possible, between those activities that are fun, those that are fulfilling, and those that create value.

My favorite developers write code in order to figure out what to say as easily as they talk in order to figure out how to code. They understand both that a good meeting can prevent a month of wasted coding, and that a good line of code can prevent an hour of wasted meeting time. They understand that languages, platforms, management styles, and development methodologies all trade off between strengths and weaknesses, and are differently appropriate in different contexts.

My favorite co-workers want to point at something and say “we did that!”, and want to have fun getting there.
