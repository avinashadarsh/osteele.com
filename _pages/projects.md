## Hall of Fame

### Team Projects

* [Apple Dylan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Dylan) was an attempt to make the concepts in Lisp applicable to application programming. Modern alternatives: Java, JavaScript, C#, and Objective C get 90% of the way there.

* [QuickDraw GX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw_GX) (Skia) and AlphaMask were early 2D graphics engines with configurable rendering pipelines. Modern alternatives: Cairo, Antigrain, and the (not-coincidentally-named) [Skia Graphics Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skia_Graphics_Engine).

* [OpenLaszlo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenLaszlo) introduced(?) constraint programming (aka KVO), data binding, and declarative components to application programming and to the web. Modern alternatives: React, Redux, Elm.

### Personal Projects
