<p><dfn>Nebula</dfn> is a suggestion of swirling clouds of
self-illuminated gas.  It simulates the mixture of multiple layers of
paint combined with video feedback around multiple points of symmetry
dispersed in space.</p>

<p>Nebula is based on <dfn>Frost and Fire</dfn>, a screen saver I
wrote for the Macintosh in 1989. Frost and Fire used a bitmap rotation
algorithm I had invented when I heard someone had done uncached
microcomputer bitmap rotation at interactive rates. ("Someone" was
Live Picture, and the report was wrong &#151; they used a precomputed
cache.) Ten years later, interactive bitmap rotation doesn't take any
special tricks: incrementally compiled floating point Java is faster
than hand-coded fixed-point assembly was a decade ago.</p>
