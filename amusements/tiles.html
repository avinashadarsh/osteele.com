<p><dfn>Tiles</dfn> manipulates an array of cells, each of which is
either a square, two triangles separated by a bend dexter, or two
triangles separated by a bend sinister.  But instead of showing you
these shapes, Tiles displays their dual.  Relatively simple patterns
in shape space (the dual of the space you're seeing) have duals that
are all squares, octagons mingled with squares, and, amazingly, a
tiling of the plane with (irregular, of course) pentagons.</p>
