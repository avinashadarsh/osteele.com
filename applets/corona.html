<P><DFN>Corona</DFN> simulates video feedback to create a series of images.  Occasionally some fractals show up.  Believe it or not, you can get some of the same effects with a camcorder and a color TV in a dark room -- the shadow mask and the CCD add a couple of steps of spatial quantization after each frame, and this is what produces the instability at the fractals' edges.</P>

<P>I wrote the first version of Corona, <DFN>Frost and Fire</DFN>, at Apple Computer in 1989.  It used a speedy new bitmap rotation algorithm I had invented when I heard someone else could do bitmap rotation, without precomputation, faster than we could.  ("Someone" was Live Picture, and the report was wrong.)  The new version walks through parameter space differently and manipulates the color channels independently for a more "analogue" feel.  Also, ten years later, I can do bitmap rotation without any clever tricks:  incrementally compiled Java with floating point is still faster than my hand-coded fixed-point assembly was a decade ago.</P>
