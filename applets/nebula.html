<P><DFN>Nebula</DFN> is a suggestion of swirling clouds of self-illuminated gas. 
  It simulates the mixture of multiple layers of paint combined with video feedback 
  around multiple points of symmetry dispersed in space.</P>
<P>Nebula is based on <DFN>Frost and Fire</DFN>, a screen saver I wrote for the 
  Macintosh in 1989. Frost and Fire used a bitmap rotation algorithm I had invented 
  when I heard someone had done uncached microcomputer bitmap rotation at interactive 
  rates. ("Someone" was Live Picture, and the report was wrong &#151; they used 
  a precomputed cache.) Ten years later, interactive bitmap rotation doesn't take 
  any special tricks: incrementally compiled floating point Java is faster than 
  hand-coded fixed-point assembly was a decade ago.</P>
