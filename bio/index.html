<p>I'm a software developer, old enough to remember when it was called &#x201C;programming&#x201D;.  I'm also a software manager, but I only like being a manager in <a href="http://www.accel-team.com/human_relations/hrels_03_mcgregor.html">Theory Y</a> companies.</p>

<p>I'm most interested in areas where knowledge representation, computer languages, and presentation graphics come together.  This sounds esoteric, but I make it work for me.  My graduate work was in formal semantics and computer theory, with a side of cognitive psychology.</p>

<p>I'm interested in how programming languages and methodologies can make expert programmers more productive at writing truly interesting applications.</p>

<p>I have two children, ages six and ten.  My <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/people/marg/">wife</a> and <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/~minsky/">father in law</a> are also in the computer profession.</p>
