      <h2>Separate Selves</h2>
      <p>I&#x2019;m more similar to other people my age than to my earlier self. &#xA0;There&#x2019;s an illusion of continuity because I have the same memories (or memories of memories), similar skills and deficits (good analytic capability, poor fine-motor coordination), and because the changes in my personality were gradual, but there&#x2019;s no reason for me to think of my current self as the same person as my twenty-year-old self, rather than, say, the same self as my wife or colleagues.</p>
      <p>What are the ethical implications of this?</p>
      <p>One is that it casts a different light on suicide. &#xA0;(I&#x2019;ve been thinking about suicide a lot lately, because of the death of a friend.) &#xA0;You have to be in a unique mental state to kill yourself. &#xA0;In fact, it&#x2019;s fair to say that this mental state makes you a different person from the people that used to inhabit your body, and from the people that might inhabit it later. &#xA0;If you kill your present self, you&#x2019;re also killing your future selves. &#xA0;Is this more similar to murder (which everyone agrees is wrong), or to abortion (about which there are mixed viewpoints)? &#xA0;On the one hand, you&#x2019;re killing a fully </p>
      <h2>Maps and Directions</h2>
      <p>Directions have two forms: a list of instructions, and a visual representation. &#xA0;I can&#x2019;t use the first. &#xA0;When I get a list of directions, I have to turn it into a map. &#xA0;My wife can&#x2019;t use the second. &#xA0;When she gets a map with a route on it, she has to translate it into a series of &#x201C;go straight three miles&#x201D;, &#x201C;turn left on elliot st.&#x201D;. &#xA0;I can&#x2019;t remember these.</p>
      <h2>Thinking in Pictures</h2>
      <p>Several people have asked me about the illustrations in my blog. &#xA0;These aren&#x2019;t picture i make to go along with what I&#x2019;ve written. &#xA0;the picture comes first. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s a brain dump of what&#x2019;s in my head.</p>
      <p>I used to think everybody thought like me. &#xA0;[Picture: axis visual ability; axis: verbal ability]. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t mean to . &#xA0;I&#x2019;ve just picked two axes that I&#x2019;m familiar with, because I&#x2019;m good at them. &#xA0;There&#x2019;s more axes to cognition on this (pick your favorite intelligence test or theory), but I don&#x2019;t know much about what it&#x2019;s like to have a good memory, say, because mine is lousy (my digit span is 5-6 digits, which means I can&#x2019;t remember a phone number long enough to dial it &#x2013; I&#x2019;d probably lose big on an I.Q. test for that alone). &#xA0;And let&#x2019;s not even get into E.Q. </p>
      <h2>Decisions</h2>
      <p>I&#x2019;ve noticed two different attitudes towards decision-making. &#xA0;Some people (such as myself) view decisions as transitions. &#xA0;Before you make the decision, the future looks one way (or maybe it&#x2019;s indeterminate). &#xA0;Afterwards, it looks another way. &#xA0;The point is to navigate the decision as quickly as possible, so that you can get to work on refining the post-decision world, and accommodating to it.</p>
      <p>Others (such as my wife) view decision-making as a process.</p>
      <p>In my experience there are two attitudes towards time. &#xA0;A clock-driven approach. An event-driven approach chooses actions by the (non-temporal) context and situation. &#xA0;Both of these are viable approaches to the world, but they don&#x2019;t mix well. &#xA0;Clock-driven people tend to appear inflexible; event-driven people tend to be late. &#xA0;When they try to coordinate, the difference in goals causes friction and dissent.</p>
