      <h2>Getting into getting into shape</h2>
      <p>
        Preparing to get into shape. &#xA0;There&#x2019;s some setup work to do first. &#xA0;The point is to turn your body into one that can expend a lot of calories. &#xA0;This means putting enough muscle onto it that you can exercise (muscle also increases your resting metabolism, which means your burning calories even when you 
        don&#x2019;t
         exercise), raising your cardiovascular efficiency, and increasing your lactic tolerance. &#xA0;You could optimize for: burning calories, raising your cardiovascular efficiency, or increasing your lactic acid tolerance. &#xA0;As anyone who has done engineering knows, if there are multiple factors you can&#x2019;t optimize for all of them at once.
      </p>
      <p>The most important principle is not to injure yourself. &#xA0;My rule of thumb is to only do a little more than I did the day before. &#xA0;My other rule of thumb is that if anything feels weird, sore, or damaged, to stop instantly, and not exercise that body part until a few days after it has recovered completely. &#xA0;Getting injured is like getting stopped for speeding. &#xA0;The time you lose more than wipes out any gains you made, as well as having its own penalties.</p>
      <p>
        At any one time there&#x2019;s a long pole. &#xA0;Either you get sore, or you get winded, or you get cramps, or there just isn&#x2019;t enough time for a workout. &#xA0;Identify the long pole, and work on that one; don&#x2019;t worry about the other factors until one of 
        them
         becomes the long pole:
      </p>
      <p>Sore muscles. &#xA0;Wait until they heal. &#xA0;Learn to identify the difference between DOMS and injury. &#xA0;Actually, if you wait until you&#x2019;re not sore you don&#x2019;t need to. &#xA0;If it&#x2019;s DOMS it will take a day (if it&#x2019;s a small muscle such as your abdominals, or if you&#x2019;re very young), or two days (if you&#x2019;re in your twenties or early thirties), or three days (if you&#x2019;re forty &#x2013; I don&#x2019;t now anything past her), or five days (if it&#x2019;s the first time in your life that you&#x2019;ve ever exercised a muscle). &#xA0;You can get soreness from weight or from duration. &#xA0;When I started running I got sore. &#xA0;Each time I ran faster I got sore again.</p>
      <p>
        Out of breath. &#xA0;This is cardiovascular fitness. &#xA0;What your body needs to do is increase your heart size, expand your circulatory system, etc. &#xA0;But you don&#x2019;t need to know this. &#xA0;What 
        you
         need to do is spend as much time as you can going as fast as you can. &#xA0;The way to do this is interval training. &#xA0;After you warm up, run (if running is your exercise) as fast as you can for a minute, and then drop your speed, and repeat. &#xA0;You&#x2019;ll be able to go faster and longer that way than if you try to do it all at one burst. &#xA0;When I&#x2019;m running on a treadmill, I run at the following speeds (in mph, each for one minute): 6,7,8,9,9; 6,7,8,8,9; 6,7,7,8,9; 6,6,7,8,9. &#xA0;When I&#x2019;m in peak shape, I add a minute to each of these. &#xA0;When I&#x2019;m in the best shape I&#x2019;ve ever been, I add two minutes. &#xA0;(11 mph feels like the fastest a human can go, and it&#x2019;s all I can do to sustain a minute. &#xA0;Then I remind myself that I&#x2019;d have to run that fast for 2 1/3 hours to qualify for a marathon***, and that i&#x2019;d have to run 4mp faster (x%) to run a 4m miles.
      </p>
      <p>Muscle cramps. &#xA0;This is the opposite of cardiovascular. &#xA0;You want a sustained pace</p>
      <p>
        But all this is just to tune up to the point where you 
        can
         exercise. &#xA0;Once you&#x2019;re tuned up, you won&#x2019;t get sore muscles, or cramps, or out of breath.
      </p>
      <p>&#x201C;Yes pain no gain.&#x201D; &#xA0;Exercise might be uncomfortable, but not painful &#x2013; at least, not while you&#x2019;re doing it.</p>
      <h2>Calorie Accounting</h2>
      <p>Here&#x2019;s a few tips on weight maintenance. &#xA0;The high bit is that calorie expenditure needs to exceed calorie intake. &#xA0;You can work with either side of the equation: increasing calorie expenditure (mostly exercise, but there&#x2019;s a few tricks), and decreasing calorie intake (&#x201D;dieting&#x201D;, but the word implies willpower, which isn&#x2019;t the most effective dieting technique for most of us).</p>
      <h2>The only rep that matters</h2>
      <p>The point in muscle.</p>
      <h2>Back Out</h2>
      <p>Or, a Sharp Pain in the Ass</p>
      <p>In fall of 2001, my back went out. &#xA0;For a while, I had sciatica (a pain in the leg that felt like a live wire had been implanted in the muscle), and then my disk ruptured on one side, and then on the other, and then I underwent a four-hour operation to remove the material that was impinging on the nerves projecting from my spine.</p>
      <p>Now I&#x2019;m in better shape than I was then. In fact, in most ways I&#x2019;m in better shape than I was in my twenties. &#xA0;Different, but better. &#xA0;(My disk will never be the same, but for the first time in my life I have strong enough torso muscles and good enough posture to protect them.) &#xA0;There&#x2019;s nothing like the threat, and memory, of unbearable pain to make you take care of your body.</p>
