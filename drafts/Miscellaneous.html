      <h2>Why I Stopped Buying Music</h2>
      <h2>Beauty and Brains</h2>
      <p>I used to believe it was unfair to favor beautiful people. &#xA0;They were just lucky to be beautiful; luck isn&#x2019;t fair; and it would compound the unfairness to favor the lucky.</p>
      <p>At the same time, I thought it was fine to favor smart people.</p>
      <p>Notice the contradiction here?</p>
      <p>One assumption was that you didn&#x2019;t have to work to be beautiful. &#xA0;But you do. &#xA0;Some of beauty is bone structure &#x2013; you can&#x2019;t change that. &#xA0;Some of it is complexion. &#xA0;Cf. Paul Graham&#x2019;s essay about being popular: it takes a lot of work. &#xA0;Beauty takes a lot of work too.</p>
      <p>So why not reward it?</p>
      <p>One answer is that, unlike being smart, being beautiful isn&#x2019;t functional. &#xA0;But seeming smart isn&#x2019;t functional either. &#xA0;Although the same raw ingredients can make you seem smart and make you useful too, there&#x2019;s a lot of work in one that isn&#x2019;t in the other. &#xA0;(Robert De Niro said that he chose between being a personality and being an actor, because he didn&#x2019;t think he could do both.) &#xA0;Also, intelligence helps in being attractive too, just like it helps in almost anything.</p>
      <p>Many beautiful actresses aren&#x2019;t that physically attractive, or wouldn&#x2019;t be if someone else&#x2019;s brain were living in them. &#xA0;(I can&#x2019;t speak about beautiful actors. &#xA0;I just don&#x2019;t pay enough attention. &#xA0;Although I bet that Brad Pitt spends a lot of time working on his body.) &#xA0;Part of it is that, like athletes, they take care of their body. &#xA0;So don&#x2019;t compare an actress to the population at large; compare an actress to people you see jogging or at the gym. &#xA0;Part of it is that they act beautiful. &#xA0;John Travolta said about Saturday Night Live that he didn&#x2019;t actually know how to dance; he just acted dancing. &#xA0;(At first I thought this was ridiculous. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s like saying you don&#x2019;t really know how to pass a standardized test, but you passed it anyway by acting knowledgeable. &#xA0;But maybe it&#x2019;s more like acting like you know French. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t know French; if you&#x2019;ve practiced for a while, you can probably fool me.) &#xA0;Actresses act beautiful. </p>
