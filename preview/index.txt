h3. Early and Late Adoption

Eclipse is useful to two classes of developers:
* Those who are able and have time to hack on it to accomodate new technologies
* Those who aren't interested in using new technologies until they've been around for long enought o have this kind of editor support.

This leaves out the middle group, of early technology adopters who aren't active developer tool framework developers.  That's the niche for emacs and vim.

There's another way to slice this, which is how much you want to avoid repetition.
