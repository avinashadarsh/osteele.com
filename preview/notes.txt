Functions in Java are deeply nested in hte API, and require a lot of plumbing and intermediate objects to get to them.  Functions in Python and PHP are easy to get at.

There should be a complexity metric for API design: given a use case, how many intermediate getters or constructors do you need to create to get to the API that implements the functionality for that use case.  If the number is high, having a large library doesn't buy you that much.
