<blockquote>There's only one computer science joke, and this is it.</blockquote>

<p>My son likes this riddle:</p>

<blockquote>
There's two types of people:
<ul>
<li>People who think there's two types of people.</li>
<li>People who don't think there's two types of people.</li>
<li>People who aren't sure.</li></ul>

<p>Which one am I?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It combines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_paradox">Russell's Paradox</a> with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_paradox">Liar Paradox</a>, and throws in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intension">intensionality</a> to boot.</p>
