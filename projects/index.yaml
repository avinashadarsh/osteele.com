  description: >
    html2db.xsl converts an XHTML source document into a Docbook output document.  It provides features for customizing the generation of the output, so that the output can be tuned by annotating the source, rather than hand-editing the output. This makes it useful in a processing pipeline where the source documents are maintained in HTML, although it can be used as a one-time conversion tool too.  This was written as part of the OpenLaszlo doc pipeline.

    Flash Troll Generator is a timesaving tool for anti-Flash posters. I couldn't bear the thought of so much human time wasted on recapitulating the same reactions to every post that mentioned Flash. I hope that with an hour of work, I've saved everyone else thousands of hours that can be spent on something more productive.

  description: static-preview.php allows you to preview files that you edit on your server's filesystem, without storing them in the WordPress database. It is intended for the case where you have access to the file system of your web server or a staging server capable of running php. It allows you to use a text editor such as emacs to edit a file in one window and preview the results in another window. This gives you more full-featured editing than the web browser, and a faster edit-preview workflow cycle than copying between a text editor and and the WordPress Writing web form.
