      and have developed a curriculum for teach abstract algebra at
      the elementary level.</span></li><li><span class="interestTitle">Open Source Software</span>. <span class="interestDescription">I like to read and write open source software
      in my off hours.  It's fun, and it allows me to explore
      techniques that are too risky to try out on a funded project
      with a hard deadline.  My more popular contributions include
      PyWordNet (now a part of the Natural Language Tool Kit),
      OpenLaszlo:JSON, OpenLaszlo:Ruby, and Functional JavaScript.
      The OpenLaszlo project itself (which I serially architected,
      managed, and directed) was an exception in that it was funded,
      and that it was not originally an open-source
      project.</span></li><li><span class="interestTitle">Programming Languages</span>. <span class="interestDescription">I like learning languages that teach me new
      ways to think about programming.  The good ones also teach me
      new ways to think about project management, executive
      management, and life.</span></li></ul><p class="lastModified">Last modified December 2007.</p></div></body></html>
