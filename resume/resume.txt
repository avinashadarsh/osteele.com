    CTO
    AlphaMask, Inc.
    June 2000-October 2001
    
    AlphaMask was a technology company based upon a 2D graphics software
    library developed at Headspin (which was later acquired by Cyan).
    During my tenure I developed a product line and a sales tool which
    was used to sell the company to OpenWave.
    
    Achievements:
    * Defined a product suite with server, desktop, and embedded
      editions.
    * Created SVG and SMIL interpreters and transcoders.

    Consultant
    Lexeme, Inc.
    1999-2000
    
    Lexeme (later LingoMotors) created a knowledge extraction system
    that parsed natural langage into structured semantic structures, and
    used these structures to implement natural-language query response
    and description categorization (as for a product catalog or
    location-based event listing).
    
    Achievements:
    * Extended the Lexeme chart parser with rules composed of
      regular-expression patterns over lexical, syntactic, and semantic
      tests.
    * Created a graphical workbench for linguists to edit and test these
      patterns.
    * Created disambiguation algorithms for prioritizing parses based on
      lexical frequency, and on coverage of partially parsed utterances.
    * Extended the web server with session management facilities and
      Smalltalk-based dynamic server page extensions.
    * Built infrastructure: unit-testing, automated error recovery email
      and email notification daemons for the server.
    
    
    Research Assistant
    Brandeis CS Department

    * Teaching Assistant: Natural Language Processing
    * Medstract
    
    Achievements:
    * TA'd courses in Scheme, Artificial Intelligence, and Language
      Processing. This included lectures and designing problems sets as
      well as grading.
    * Created a regular-expression to FSA compiler, an FSA optimizer, a
      chart-parser with FSA rules, a rule compiler that combined
      multiple FSAs into a single FSA with multiple labelled terminal
      nodes, and a node compiler that compiled an FSA node and arcs into
      a decision tree.
    
    
    Chief Epistemology Officer
    Method Software, Inc.
    1997-1998

    gaming failed to materialize, this was repurposed into a a distance
    learning tool for online business negotiation.
    
    Achievements:
    * Designed and implemented a Scheme-based language for defining
      objects, properties, and rules for a game world, and for defining
      non-player characters (NPCs) and their behaviors and grammars.
    * Implemented an NPC parser, a command-line parser for a subset of
      imperative English, and a scene and event description generator.
