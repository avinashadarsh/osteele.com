Professional Objective:

    Engaging part-time consulting work on challenging projects with
    brilliant people; at the management, architecture, or algorithm
    design level. My experience is greatest in the areas programming
    language, graphic systems, language processing, and knowledge
    representation, but enjoy working on hard problems and the
    architecture complex systems across all domains.

    browsing engine that is currently in private beta.
    
    Achievements:
    * Designed and implemented the core server and client functionality.

    Laszlo Systems created a development platform for rich internet
    applications, compiled (initially) to Flash and (later) to SVG and
    HTML. We developed a set of APIs comparable to Macromedia's Flex
    product, which the latter company introduced later.
    
    In June 2005 I was promoted to VP OpenLaszlo, and also asked to fill
    in as acting VP Engineering for a quarter. I moved to California for
    the summer of 2005 for the latter role. At the end of this period I
    was invited to remain as permanent VP Engineering, but I didn't want
    to move my family to California at that time.

    I originally began working with Laszlo (a San Francisco company) as
    a contractor. After six months we decided we like each other enough
    to keep seeing each other, and I signed on as CSA and started the
    Boston office.
    
    Achievements:
    * Created and managed the Boston office
    * Hired the East Coast product development team
    * Created and managed the contribution process
    * Presented the company and technology at industry events
    * Managed the IBM development relation, which lead to multiple press
      releases and to the release of IDE4Laszlo, Faces for Laszlo, the
      inclusion of the OpenLaszlo platform in IBM’s ETTK (Enterprise
      Technology Tool Kit)
    * Relaunched the OpenLaszlo web site
    * Released OpenLaszlo 3.0 on schedule concurrent with IDE4Laszlo 2.0
      and web site relaunch.
    * Designed the Laszlo XML programming language
    * Launched and lead the OpenLaszlo (open source) project
    * Lead the documentation effort and created and then oversaw the

    CTO
    AlphaMask, Inc.
    June 2000-October 2001
    
    AlphaMask was a technology company based upon a 2D graphics software
    library developed at Headspin, Inc. (Headspin was acquired by Cyanas

    a product line and participated in pitching the company to OpenWave,
    which acquired it.

    * Defined a product suite with server, desktop, and embedded
      editions.
    * Created SVG and SMIL interpreters and transcoders.
    * Created XML, server-side imaging, and image transcoding products
    * Created tools for distributing custom source and binary
      distributions.
    
    
    Technical Consultant
    Lexeme, Inc.
    1999-2000
    
    Lexeme (later LingoMotors) created a knowledge extraction system
    that parsed natural langage into structured semantic structures, and
    used these structures to implement natural-language query response
    and description categorization (as for a product catalog or
    location-based event listing).
    
    Achievements:
    * Extended the Lexeme chart parser with rules composed of
      regular-expression patterns over lexical, syntactic, and semantic
      tests.
    * Created a graphical workbench for linguists to edit and test these
      patterns.
    * Created disambiguation algorithms for prioritizing parses based on
      lexical frequency, and on coverage of partially parsed utterances.
    * Extended the web server with session management facilities and
      Smalltalk-based dynamic server page extensions.
    * Built infrastructure: unit-testing, automated error recovery email
      and email notification daemons for the server.
    
    
    Research Assistant
    Brandeis CS Department
    1999-2000

    techniques to create a catalogue of gene and protein interactions
    from abstracts in the Medline database.

      Processing. This included lectures and designing problems sets as
      well as grading.
    * Created a regular-expression to FSA compiler, an FSA optimizer, a
      chart-parser with FSA rules, a rule compiler that combined
      multiple FSAs into a single FSA with multiple labelled terminal
      nodes, and a node compiler that compiled an FSA node and arcs into
      a decision tree.
    
    
    Chief Epistemology Officer
    Method Software, Inc.
    1997-1998
    
    Method Software developed a Java client-server system for hosting
    multiplayer role-playing games. After a business model for online
    gaming failed to materialize, this was repurposed into a a distance
    learning tool for online business negotiation.
    
    Achievements:

      objects, properties, and rules for a game world, and for defining
      non-player characters (NPCs) and their behaviors and grammars.

      imperative English, and a scene and event description generator.
