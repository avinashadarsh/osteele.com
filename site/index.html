<h2>Content Creation</h2>

<p>We're four years<sup class="footnote-ref" id="four-years-body"><a href="#four-years">*</a></sup> into the twenty-first century and still nothing has caught up with <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html">Emacs</a> as a tool for automating the repetition out of editing and program workflow.  I'm hoping for something that makes more effective use of bitmap displays in the <em>next</em> millenium, though.</p>

<p>James Clark's <a href="http://www.thaiopensource.com/download/">nxml-mode</a> makes Emacs more palatable.  It's why I switched from <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</a>, whose "batteries included" philosophy had previously won me over to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnigraffle/">OmniGraffle</a> is the perfect drawing program for someone who can't draw.  When I need to render a diagram, it makes it look like I knew what I was doing.  Like many Mac programs, good design choices are baked into the program.  Please <a href="/contact">tell me</a> if there's anything like this for the PC!</p>

<h2>Publishing</h2>

<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> is responsible for compositing the pages.  I cut my blogging teeth on <a href="http://movabletype.org/">MovableType</a> and wouldn't even have minded paying for it again, but got tired of the page rebuilds and excited by the pace of WP development after the MT exodus.  (I used to use a variety of custom solutions, starting with some homebrew Lisp code in 1995.)</p>

<p>WordPress is built with <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>.  I like <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> better than PHP, and my <a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/hqm/index.html">brother in law</a> keeps telling me that <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> is better than MySQL, but I'd rather use a well-crafted solution assembled from suboptimal pieces than build this particular beast myself.

<p>The <a href="/projects/pywordnet/">PyWordNet docs</a> are an experiment in using <a href="http://docbook.sourceforge.net/projects/xsl/">DocBook</a>, <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant</a>, and some custom <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">XSLT</a> to build a site.</p>

<h2>Hosting</h2>

<p><a href="http://dreamhost.com/">DreamHost</a> does my hosting.  They don't run Java (I can understand why) or X11; other than that, I'm very happy with them.</p>

<h2>Staging</h2>

<p>I use a <a href="http://www.dell.com/">Dell Latitude</a> running <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/default.mspx">Windows XP</a> and <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> as my editing station and staging server.  I'd like to switch back to a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">Macintosh</a>, but I really like the sub-four-pound form factor that you can get with a PC.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>I'm not a designer (no snide comments, please!), but I enjoy trying to learn enough about design and design tools that I can appreciate what designers do.  I've drawn inspiration for this site &#x201C;design&#x201D; from the default WordPress distribution by Dave Shea and Matthew Mullenweg, from <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com/">Stopdesign</a> by Douglas Bowman, and from Alex King, most recently.  Graphic design glitches are purely mine, and are because (1) I'm still learning CSS and (2) my eye isn't that good anyway, and will be slowly addressed over the next decade.</p>
