<dd><p>I like to edit my postings with a text editor, not a browser form.
I also often edit them while I'm offline.  But I like to preview
how they'll look when they're run through the WordPress filters
such as Textile.</p>

<p><code>static-preview.php</code> allows you to preview files that you
edit on your server's filesystem, without storing them in the
WordPress database.  It is intended for the case where you have access
to the file system of your web server or a staging server capable of
running php.  It allows you to use a text editor such as emacs to edit
a file in one window and preview the results in another window.  This
gives you more full-featured editing than the web browser, and a
faster edit-preview workflow cycle than copying between a text editor
and and the WordPress Writing web form.</p>
