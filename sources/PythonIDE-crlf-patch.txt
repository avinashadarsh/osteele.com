Despite the best intentions of Anarchie and Internet Explorer, I often end up
with Python source files (and other text files that I'd like to edit with
PythonIDE) that use '\n' instead of '\r' as a line separator (and therefore show
up as garbage in the text editing window).

The following patch causes PythonIDE to notice when you open such a file, and
offer to convert its '\n's to '\r's.

Add the following to the end of Editor.__init__ in {Python}:IDE:IDELib:IDE:PyEdit.py:
		if '\n' in text:
			import EasyDialogs
			if string.find(text, '\r\n') >= 0:
				sourceOS = 'DOS'
				searchString = '\r\n'
			else:
				sourceOS = 'UNIX'
				searchString = '\n'
			change = EasyDialogs.AskYesNoCancel('³%s² contains %s-style line feeds.  Change them to MacOS carriage returns?' % (self.title, sourceOS), 1)
			# bug: Cancel is treated as No
			if change > 0:
				text = string.replace(text, searchString, '\r')
				self.editgroup.editor.set(text, self.getfilename())
				self.editgroup.editor.changed = 1
