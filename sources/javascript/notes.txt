Inline JavaScript Console

Abstract: inline-console.js embeds an console with an evaluator field in your web page.  I use this for read-event-print loop debugging of my web applications.

Debugging Javascript
Last week for the first time I did <a href="/tools/rework">some serious browser JavaScript programming</a>.  I put the following tools to good use, but ran against limits with each of them:
* "fvLogger":http://www.alistapart.com/articles/jslogging
 is terrific, but doesn't include an evaluator.  You have to reload your page each time you want to query a new value.
* Rhino is great for pure logic, but you can't use it with anything that use a browser API.  In fact, you can't use it with anything *that uses anything* that uses a browser API.  This means, for example, that you can't use it with a library that uses Prototype, without writing some mock objects first.
* The "JavaScript Shell":http://www.squarefree.com/shell/ is pretty amazing, but I wanted something a bit lighter weight (within the same window), and that works in Safari.

<a href="/sources/javascript/inline-console.js"><tt>inline-console.js</tt></a> adds an output console, and a text field with an "Eval" button to the bottom of your application.  It also defines some logging function --- <tt>info</tt>, <tt>debug</tt>, <tt>warn</tt>, and <tt>error</tt> --- that will append text to the console.  (If you include "fvlogger":http://www.alistapart.com/articles/jslogging, it will use it instead.)

The point of this is to be as lightweight as possible.  Simply add:
[code]<script type="text/javascript" src="inline-console.js"></script>[code] to you HTML head, and it will take care of adding the UI.

For added fun, include "readable.js":/archives/2005/03/readable-javascript-values after <tt>inline-console.js</tt>.  Then <code>{a: 1}</code> will print as <tt>{a: 1}</tt> instead of <code>[object Object]</code>.

Here's an example.  (Click <a href="/sources/javascript/inline-eval-demo.html" target="_blank">here</a> to see it in a separate window, where you can view source.)

<iframe src="/sources/javascript/inline-eval-demo.html" width="300" height="200"></iframe>

Files:
* "inline-console.js":/sources/javascript/inline-console.js --- adds the inline console
* "readable.js":/sources/javascript/readable.js --- adds readables representations for JavaScript objects (optional)
* "fvlogger":http://www.alistapart.com/articles/jslogging --- a nicer console UI with more control over which log levels are displayed (optional)
