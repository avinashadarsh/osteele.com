Debugging Javascript
Last week for the first time I did <a href="/tools/rework">some serious browser JavaScript programming</a>.  I put the following tools to good use, but ran against limits with each of them:
* "fvLogger":http://www.alistapart.com/articles/jslogging
 is terrific, but doesn't include an evaluator.  You have to reload your page each time you want to query a new value.
* Rhino is great for pure logic, but you can't use it with anything that use a browser API, or that uses anything *that uses anything* that uses a browser API.  This means you can't use it with Prototype, for example, without writing some mock objects first.
* The JavaScript Shell is pretty amazing, but I wanted something lighter weight (within the same window), and I wanted something that works in Safari and IE so I could track down cross-platform bugs.

Here's what I ended up writing:
* readable.js adds readables representations to for JavaScript objects
* inline-eval.js adds an Eval field to your program, for read-event-print loop exploration.  You can see it in action in the iframe below.

h3. readable.js
readable.js adds readable representations to JavaScript objects.  For example, <kbd> [1,'',[2,3],[]]</kbd> prints as <tt> [1,'',[2,3],[]]</tt> instead of <tt>1,,2,3,</tt>; <kbd>{key: 1}</kbd> prints as <tt>{key: 1}</tt> instead of <tt>1</tt>; and <kbd>{a: 1, b: 2}</kbd> prints at all.

readable works by overriding Array.prototype.toString and Object.prototype.toString.  In principle, it could break things --- for example, code that depend on ['one','two','three'].toString() evaluating to "one,two,three".  In practice, this was what was most convenient for me --- it means that I can use the Rhino command line to print values readably, without having to wrap them in an extra function call.
