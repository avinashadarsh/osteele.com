    <h1>Documentation for Extended Live Archive Plugin, version 0.10beta-r5 </h1>
    <p>The Extended Live Archive plugin is one selfcontained bundle called af-extended-live-archive, which should be put into the plugin folder to yield the following structure:</p>
    <pre>
	wp-content/
		\_...
		\_ plugins/
	   		\_...
	   		\_ af-extended-live-archive/
				\_ af-extended-live-archive.php
				\_ af-extended-live-archive-options.php
	   			\_ includes/
					\_ af-extended-live-archive.js
					\_ af-ela.php
					\_ af-elaAddLoadEvent.js
					\_ af-ela-style.css
</pre>
    <p>The plugin writes some javascript information to the header of each page, and provides a single template function called af_ela_super_archive(). 
    The function af_ela_super_archive() can takes arguments, as for 0.9.x versions, in the url format as seen in <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/wp_list_pages">wp_list_cats</a>, that are described in all 0.9.x packages.</p>
    <p><strong>However, it is STRONGLY recommended that one uses the option panel the plugin is adding to the admin pages to configure ELA. </strong></p>
    <p>Doing so, all one has to do to display the Extended Live Archive is to add a <code>&lt;?php af_ela_super_archive(); ?&gt;</code> call wherever one wants to stuff to show up.</p>
    <p>Note that if you are using K2 beta one r96+, the archives page is already doing that for you.</p>
    <p>To install the plugin, upload the af-extended-archive directory and its content to your wp-content/plugins/ directory. Then, visit the option->Ext. Live Archive page once to initialize it.</p>
