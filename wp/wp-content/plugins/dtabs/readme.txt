A plugin for the easy creation of dynamic tabs and drop down menus via an admin panel for posts, pages, categories, archives, bookmarks and more.

== Description ==

Provides a function to output a user controled dynamically tabbed navigation system with optional drop down menus in Wordpress.  

Basically, it makes adding dynamic tabs to your Wordpress blog/theme easy.

See [Other Notes](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/dtabs/other_notes/) for documentation.

= ...some more info =
* Tabs can be made for the posts page, the front page, individual posts, categories, pages, the archives, and the bookmarks.
* Tabs for categories and pages have optional dropdown menus of their sub-categories/sub-pages, while archives and bookmarks have non-optional drop down menus.
* Tabs are set up by the user via administrator preferences, while their properties and appearance can either be set by the user via administrator preferences or within the theme's css.
* dTabs can be easily added as an option in themes for public distribution.

== Installation ==

1. Upload dtabs.php to your Wordpress Plugins directory.
1. Activate dTabs in the Plugins section of the admin control panel.

Please note that if your theme is not pre-enabled for dTabs you need to [paste a snippet](http://dynamictangentconceptions.dtcnet.co.uk/downloads/wp-plugins/dtabs-dynamic-tabs-wordpress-plugin/#enabletheme "Adding dTabs to your theme") of code into your theme before your tabs will appear on your blog, alternatively/in addition you could ask your theme's author to pre-enable your theme.

Yep this can be achieved with css, have a play.
