                                Explanation
===============================================================================
--------
Messages
--------
At the top of the page just below the nav-bar you should see a message panel.
Any messages generated by KIN will be displayed here. You have the option of
rolling up the panel so only the title shows, or close it completely.

If closed completely, you can still recall it by clicking on the messages
link (Xi symbol), which will toggle it back into view.

It is recommended that you leave the message box open until you are sure you
won't be missing any crucial messages. The rollup / open /close state persists
across sessions.

Global Panel
------------
Buttons     Description
-------     -----------
Purge       This will delete all KIN data from the database. This would be
            useful if you want a clean slate, or if you want to unistall KIN.
Update      Updates all record sets with current data simultaneously.

-------
Nav-Bar
-------
All navigation is done via a nav-bar. The nav-bar is shown at the top of the
page for quick access to the navigation links.

The nav-bar is it remembers the note you were viewing and will restore the
state the page was in the last time you were there.

Explanation
-----------
The following is an attempt at representing the nav-bar without using utf-8
encoded character entities, or colours. To make things easier, it's been split
in two. First is the left side, then the right. Replace words in angle brackets
with a corresponding symbol that you see onscreen. Eg. Global = Theta symbol
on the nav-bar. "n" represents any number greater than 1, so 1...n just means
a bunch of numbers starting from 1. So if there were five record sets you would
see "1 2 3 4 5" as the links to their corresponding panels.

It's a long stretch I know, but I'm sure you can work it out - just think of
it as an exercise in lateral thinking.

Nav-Bar: Left-Side
------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1...n + <Global> [...]                                                      ...
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Link        Description
----        -----------
1...n:      Links to each record set panel.
+:          Add record set.
<Global>    For making global changes. (Theta symbol)
[...]       Displays minimised record sets.

Note: n = any number greater than 1.

Nav-Bar: Right-Side
-------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
...                                << < > >> <Up> <Down> <Messages> <Font Size>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Link                Description
----                -----------
<< < > >>:          First record, previous record, next record, last record.
<Up> <Down>:        Jumps to page top, jump to page bottom. (Up/Down arrows)
<Messages>:         Shows / hide messages. (Xi symbol)
<Font Size>:        Toggles between small and large fonts for Nav-Bar


Panel links
-----------
Link        Description
----        -----------
-/+:        Toggle panel contents show/hide.
X:          Close panel.


===============================================================================
                                    F.A.Q.
===============================================================================
Q: What the hell is wrong with the Nav-Bar links? It's not working! The links
    are not being highlighted properly and they aren't responding properly!
A: Make sure you only have one instance of KIN open at a time. If you have more
    than one instance of KIN open, the cookie system that Nav-Bar uses becomes
    "confused".


===============================================================================
                                   Notes
===============================================================================
This plugin came about from a suggestion made by Lois (http://eyesapart.com/),
who was looking for a notepad plugin, but could not find one that suited his
needs.

Originally, I was going to make a notepad addon for KCA, but decided to turn
KIN into a plugin instead, since not everyone would be comfortable with using
KCA.

After thinking about where to put the link for the notepad, I decided the best
place for it would be in the top level admin menu, since this menu would be
accessible from anywhere in the admin section.

This plugin has been developed under Wordpress 1.5.2 and 1.6-ALPHA-2-still-
dont-use, but hasn't been tested in older versions. You can give it a try if
you wish, but I'm not going to be held responsible if anything horrible
happens.

If you are prudent and do backups before experimenting with new plugins, you
should not have anything to worry about.

Having said that, I'm quite certain that the only horrible thing that might
happen after installation of this plugin is the fact that the author can be
quite lazy and updates are far and few in between. Hopefully, the code is
relatively bug-free and there won't be a need to update too regularly!

If, you do find bugs however, or have some questions about how something
works, or just want to say hi, you can contact me at:

Enjoy!

John Ha.
